    <h1>The Escape of the Underworld</h1>
    <p>
      Percy, Annabeth, and Grover run through the left path of the tunnel and encounter a dead end. Grover tripped on something that ended up being a lever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabeth shouted, “Wait! We need to get out, this is a trap!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they could run away, prison bars appeared from the ground and trapped them at the end of the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least the tunnel's small enough so that Cerberus can't get us,” said Percy, laughing nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabeth looked at the bars and quickly found a lock with a four-digit code. She searched everywhere and found writing on the tunnel.
    </p>
    <blockquote> <em>
      “Three fates weave destiny's line,<br>
      A secret code, their path defines.<br>
      Count them well, from first to last,<br>
      The code revealed, your escape amassed.<br><br>

      The second, count the horns of the creature seen,<br>
      In the mighty maze known to cause a scene.<br>
      Count them true, don't be misled,<br>
      To the third, sum the guard dog's heads.<br><br>

      For the fourth, use the next prime,<br>
      Complete the code, in this rhyme.<br>
      From left to right, the sequence true,<br>
      Your path to freedom, now in view.”
    </em>

      Using the hint, enter the four-digit code to get through.
